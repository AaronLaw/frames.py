What to do when nothing else helps? Walk the stack trace, of course.

Is it a good idea?   | It depends.
Is it slow?          | Terribly.
Is it cool?          | Fuck yeah!

I want it, now!
---------------

> pip install frames

--------
But how?
--------

>>> import frames

Seriously?           | Okay, okay.

>>> frames.locate_frame(lambda f: 'BOOM' in f.f_locals)

Boom what?           | Meh...

>>> frames.locate_frame(
...     lambda f: f.locals.get('__name__') == '__main__'
... ).locals['BOOM'] = 'Yeah'

Heh?                 | This is getting boring ;(

>>> BOOM
'Yeah'

------------------------------------
But you just wrap the system frames?
------------------------------------

Yep, this is a tiny wrapper. That's all it is.

Thank you!

Goodbye!
